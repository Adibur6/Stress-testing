# Stress Testing Repository

This repository is designed for stress testing programming problems, particularly to find edge cases in solutions. It employs a systematic approach to ensure the correctness of the provided solution (`solution.cpp`) by comparing it to a correct solution (typically a brute-force approach) implemented in `brute.cpp`. Random test cases are generated using `gen.cpp`, and the test process is orchestrated through `test.py`.

## Workflow

1.  **Solution and Brute-force Implementation**:
    
    -   Save your solution in `solution.cpp`.
    -   Implement a correct, less optimal brute-force solution in `brute.cpp`.
2.  **Test Case Generation**:
    
    -   Utilize `gen.cpp` to generate random test cases that will be used to evaluate the correctness of your solution.
3.  **Test Execution**:
    
    -   Run the testing script using the command: `py test.py` from the terminal.
4.  **Testing Process** (Sample Interaction):
    

    ```shell
    `F:\competitive programming\stress test>py test.py
    Enter the number of test cases: 10
    1 to check against an existing brute-force solution, otherwise 0: 1
    Compiling the programs, please wait...
    Test case 1 OK!
    Test case 2 OK!
    Test case 3 OK!
    Test case 4 OK!
    Test case 5 OK!
    Test case 6 OK!
    Test case 7 OK!
    Test case 8 OK!
    Test case 9 OK!
    Test case 10 OK!` 
    ```
    
    -   The script will execute the solutions (`solution.cpp` and `brute.cpp`) for each generated test case.
    -   If the outputs from these solutions do not match, the script highlights that particular test case.
5.  **Handling Complex Problems**:
    
    -   For problems where the brute-force solution is not feasible due to variable solutions, use `acceptor.cpp` instead of `brute.cpp`. `acceptor.cpp` is designed to handle such cases.
6.  **Verification**:
    
    -   Ensure that the answer generated by `solution.cpp` is verified using the `acceptor.cpp` file. This C++ file should print `1` if the answer is accepted and `0` if rejected.

This systematic approach to stress testing helps identify edge cases and validate solutions for programming problems, ensuring their correctness and robustness.

Feel free to adapt this repository to your specific needs and problems, adding custom test case generators or acceptance criteria as required.
